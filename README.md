# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge

The Rock Paper Scissors challenge was the third weekend challenge at Makers Academy.

Our brief was as follows:

> The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

> Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
a winner will be declared
